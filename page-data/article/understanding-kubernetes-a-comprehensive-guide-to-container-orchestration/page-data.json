It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).\n\nThis article includes:\n\n * Introduction to Kubernetes\n * Containerization and the Benefits of Kubernetes\n * Key Features of Kubernetes\n * Deploying and Managing Applications with Kubernetes\n * Scaling and Auto-Scaling Applications with Kubernetes\n * Extending Kubernetes with Tools and Plugins\n * Deploying Kubernetes on Different Cloud Platforms and On-Premises Infrastructure\n * Best Practices for Using Kubernetes\n * Conclusion: The Future of Container Orchestration with Kubernetes\n\n\nDeploying and Managing Applications with Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes is designed to provide a consistent way to deploy and manage applications across multiple hosts, making it easier to scale and maintain applications in a distributed environment. It allows developers to focus on writing code, while the Kubernetes platform takes care of the underlying infrastructure.\n\n\nThe architectural concepts behind Kubernetes\n\nThere are several key architectural concepts that underlie the design of Kubernetes. These concepts help to ensure that Kubernetes is able to provide a consistent and automated way to deploy and manage applications in a distributed environment.\n\nHere are some of the key architectural concepts behind Kubernetes:\n\n 1. Clusters: A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes (physical or virtual machines) that are used to host containerized applications. The nodes in a cluster are managed by the Kubernetes control plane, which is responsible for scheduling and managing the Pods (the basic building blocks of applications in Kubernetes) that are run on the nodes.\n 2. Control plane: The control plane is the central management component of a Kubernetes cluster. It consists of a set of master nodes that are responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster and ensuring that the actual state of the cluster matches the desired state. The control plane communicates with the kubelets (daemons that run on each node) to receive updates about the state of the Pods and to provide instructions for managing them.\n 3. Pods: A Pod is the basic building block of an application in Kubernetes. It consists of one or more containers that are deployed together on the same node. Pods are designed to be ephemeral, meaning that they can be created and destroyed as needed. This allows Kubernetes to scale applications up and down as needed and to replace failed Pods with new ones. Ephemeral Containers: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/\n 4. Services: A Kubernetes Service is a logical abstraction that represents a set of Pods and the policies that should be used to access them. Services allow Pods to be accessed by other Pods or external clients using a stable IP address and DNS name, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This helps to decouple the networking between Pods from the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to deploy and manage applications in a distributed environment.\n\nThese architectural concepts help to ensure that Kubernetes is able to provide a consistent and automated way to deploy and manage applications in a distributed environment, making it easier to scale and maintain applications over time.\n\n\nKey Features of Kubernetes\n\nOne of the key features of Kubernetes is its ability to automatically scale applications based on demand. It can quickly and easily spin up additional instances of an application to handle increased traffic, and then scale back down when demand decreases. This allows developers to build highly available and resilient applications that can handle fluctuations in traffic without manual intervention.\n\n\nDeploying Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes is also designed to be highly flexible and extensible. It supports a wide range of container runtimes, such as Docker and rkt, and can be deployed on various cloud platforms, as well as on-premises infrastructure. It also has a rich ecosystem of tools and plugins that can be used to extend its capabilities.\n\n\nAutomation and Declarative configuration\n\nAnother key feature of Kubernetes is its focus on automation and declarative configuration. Instead of manually specifying how an application should be deployed and managed, developers can use declarative configuration files to define the desired state of their application. Kubernetes then takes care of ensuring that the actual state of the application matches the desired state. This makes it easier to manage and maintain applications over time, as changes can be made simply by updating the configuration files.\n\n\nKubelet\n\nThe kubelet is a key component of a Kubernetes cluster. It is a daemon that runs on each node (physical or virtual machine) in the cluster and is responsible for managing the Pods (the basic building blocks of applications in Kubernetes) that are scheduled to run on the node.\n\nkubeletSynopsis The kubelet is the primary “node agent” that runs on each node. It can register the node with the apiserver using one of: the hostname; a flag to override the hostname; or specific logic for a cloud provider.The kubelet works in terms of a PodSpec. A PodSpec is a YAML or JSON object that d…Kubernetes\n\nThe kubelet works in conjunction with the Kubernetes control plane (the central management component of a Kubernetes cluster) to ensure that the desired state of the Pods is maintained. It communicates with the control plane to receive updates about the desired state of the Pods, and then it takes the necessary actions to ensure that the actual state of the Pods matches the desired state.\n\nSome of the key responsibilities of the kubelet include:\n\n * Monitoring the health of the Pods and restarting them if they fail\n * Mounting volumes and secrets for the Pods\n * Reporting the status of the Pods to the control plane\n * Executing the container runtime (such as Docker) to run the containers within the Pods\n * Communicating with the container runtime to start and stop containers\n\nThe Kubelet plays a vital role in the operation of a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that the Pods are running as expected and that the desired state of the cluster is maintained.\n\n\nBenefits of using Kubernetes Container Orchestration\n\n\nAutomated rollouts and rollbacks\n\nKubernetes is designed to make it easier to deploy and manage applications in a distributed environment. One of the key features that helps with this is its ability to progressively roll out changes to an application or its configuration. This means that when you make a change to your application, Kubernetes will gradually implement the change across all of the instances of your application, rather than making the change all at once. This can help to minimize the risk of downtime or other issues, as the change is made gradually over time.\n\nDeploymentsA Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments…Kubernetes\n\nWhile the changes are being rolled out, Kubernetes is also monitoring the health of the application to ensure that it is not negatively impacted. If the application starts to show signs of problems, such as increased error rates or decreased performance, Kubernetes will automatically pause the rollout and wait for the issue to be resolved before continuing. This helps to ensure that the application remains available and functioning properly.\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nIf something does go wrong during a rollout, Kubernetes has the ability to automatically roll back the change. This means that it will undo the changes that were made and restore the application to its previous state. This can help to minimize the impact of problems and ensure that the application is able to recover quickly.\n\n\nService Discovery & Load Balancing\n\nOne of the key challenges of deploying and managing applications in a distributed environment is ensuring that the different components of the application are able to communicate with each other effectively. Kubernetes addresses this challenge by providing a built-in service discovery mechanism that allows Pods (the basic building blocks of applications in Kubernetes) to communicate with each other using their own IP addresses and a single DNS name.\n\nServiceExpose an application running in your cluster behind a single outward-facing endpoint, even when the workload is split across multiple backends.Kubernetes\n\nThis means that you don't need to modify your application to use a separate service discovery mechanism. Instead, you can use the built-in service discovery provided by Kubernetes to connect your Pods and allow them to communicate with each other. This can simplify the deployment process and help to make it easier to manage your application in a distributed environment.\n\nIn addition to providing service discovery, Kubernetes also includes built-in load-balancing capabilities. This means that it can automatically distribute traffic across multiple Pods, helping to ensure that your application remains available and responsive even when there is a high volume of traffic. This can help to improve the reliability and scalability of your application.\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nThe built-in service discovery and load-balancing features of Kubernetes can help to make it easier to deploy and manage applications in a distributed environment, without the need to modify your application or use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism.\n\n\nHorizontal Scaling with Kubernetes\n\nOne of the key features of Kubernetes is its ability to scale applications horizontally. This means that you can increase or decrease the number of instances of your application that are running in response to changes in demand. This can help to ensure that your application is able to handle fluctuations in traffic and maintain good performance.\n\nHorizontal Pod AutoscalingIn Kubernetes, a HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically updates a workload resource (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet), with the aim of automatically scaling the workload to match demand.Horizontal scaling means that the response to increased load is to deploy more Pods. This is different from ve…Kubernetes\n\nThere are several ways to scale your application using Kubernetes. You can use a simple command-line interface (CLI) to manually scale your application up or down, or you can use a graphical user interface (GUI) to do the same thing. Alternatively, you can set up automatic scaling based on specific triggers, such as CPU usage.\n\nTo set up automatic scaling, you can use the autoscale command in the Kubernetes CLI or use the horizontalpodautoscaler resource in a configuration file. You can specify the minimum and maximum number of replicas (instances) that you want to run, as well as the target CPU utilization that you want to maintain. Kubernetes will then automatically adjust the number of replicas based on the current CPU usage of your application.\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nThe horizontal scaling feature of Kubernetes allows you to easily and quickly scale your application up and down as needed, either manually or automatically based on specific triggers. This can help to ensure that your application is able to handle changes in demand and maintain good performance.\n\n\nUsing Kubernetes and Docker Together - for Container Orchestration\n\nKubernetes can be used with Docker docker.com to manage the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. Docker is a popular container runtime that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, standalone containers that can be easily deployed and run on any platform.\n\nTo use Kubernetes with Docker, developers can build their applications as Docker images and then use Kubernetes to manage the deployment and scaling of those images. Kubernetes can be used to create and manage clusters of Docker hosts, and it provides features such as automated rollouts and rollbacks, self-healing, and horizontal scaling to make it easier to deploy and manage containerized applications.\n\nOne of the benefits of using Kubernetes with Docker is that it allows developers to build and deploy applications using a consistent set of tools and processes, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This makes it easier to deploy applications across multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production, and it helps to reduce the complexity of managing applications in a distributed environment.\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nThe combination of Kubernetes and Docker provides a powerful platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications at scale. It allows developers to focus on writing code, while the Kubernetes platform handles the underlying infrastructure and ensures that applications are highly available and scalable.\n\n\nConclusion: The Future of Container Orchestration with Kubernetes\n\nKubernetes is a powerful and widely adopted platform for managing containerized applications at scale. It helps developers build highly available and scalable applications, while also providing a consistent and automated way to deploy and manage applications across multiple hosts.","html":"<h2 id=\"introduction-to-kubernetes\">Introduction to Kubernetes</h2><p>Kubernetes <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">kubernetes.io</a> is a popular open-source container orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

This makes it easier to deploy applications across multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production, and it helps to reduce the complexity of managing applications in a distributed environment.</p><h3 id=\"tldr-3\">tl;dr</h3><p>The combination of Kubernetes and Docker provides a powerful platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications at scale.
