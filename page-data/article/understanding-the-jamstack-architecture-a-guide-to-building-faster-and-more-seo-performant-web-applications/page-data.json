It is a web development approach that focuses on using client-side JavaScript to build web applications and websites, while relying on APIs and pre-built Markup to deliver content and functionality.\n\nWhy developers like GatsbySee what developers are saying about how they use Gatsby. Check out popular companies that use Gatsby and some tools that integrate with Gatsby.StackShare\n\n\nThe Components of the JAMstack: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup explained\n\nIn a JAMstack architecture, the \"J\" refers to JavaScript, which is used to build the client-side logic of the application or website. The \"A\" refers to APIs, which provide the backend functionality and data for the application or website. The \"M\" refers to Markup, which is the pre-built HTML, CSS, and other static files that are delivered to the client.\n\n\nBenefits of the JAMstack: Faster and more secure web development\n\nOne of the key benefits of the JAMstack approach is that it allows for faster and more secure websites and applications. Since the Markup is pre-built and delivered to the client, the server does not have to dynamically generate it on each request. This means that the server can handle a larger number of requests more efficiently, resulting in faster page load times. Additionally, since the client-side JavaScript is responsible for the majority of the application or website's functionality, there is less code that needs to be run on the server, which makes the application or website more secure.\n\nAnother benefit of the JAMstack approach is that it allows for easier deployment and scaling. Since the Markup is pre-built, it can be easily deployed to a content delivery network (CDN) or other static file hosting service, which allows for faster delivery to users around the world. Additionally, since the server-side logic is handled by APIs, the application or website can be easily scaled by adding more API servers or by using a managed API service like AWS Lambda.\n\n\nImplementing the JAMstack: Tips and best practices\n\nHere are some tips and best practices for implementing the JAMstack architecture:\n\n 1. Use a static site generator: A static site generator is a tool that allows you to build a website or application by writing content in a markup language like Markdown and then generating the HTML, CSS, and other static files that make up the site. Using a static site generator can make it easier to build and maintain a JAMstack application or website.\n 2. Use APIs for dynamic functionality: The JAMstack relies on APIs to provide the backend functionality for your application or website. When implementing the JAMstack, it's important to choose APIs that are reliable and scalable, and to design your API usage in a way that is efficient and easy to maintain.\n 3. Keep your client-side code organized: Since the JAMstack relies on client-side JavaScript for the majority of its functionality, it's important to keep your code organized and easy to understand. This can be achieved through the use of tools like module bundlers and linters, and by following good coding practices like writing clean, maintainable code and using version control.\n 4. Use a content delivery network (CDN): A CDN is a network of servers that are geographically distributed around the world and are used to deliver content to users more efficiently. When implementing the JAMstack, it's important to use a CDN to ensure that your static files are delivered quickly and reliably to users around the world.\n\n\nStatic Site Generator (SSG)\n\nA static site generator is a tool that allows you to build a website or application by writing content in a markup language like Markdown and then generating the HTML, CSS, and other static files that make up the site. Static site generators are often used in the JAMstack architecture because they allow you to build and deploy your application or website as a set of static files that can be served by a content delivery network (CDN) or other static file hosting service.\n\nOne of the main benefits of using a static site generator is that it allows you to build and maintain your application or website in a more efficient and scalable way. Since the HTML, CSS, and other static files are pre-built, they can be easily deployed and served, which means that your application or website can handle a larger number of requests more efficiently. Additionally, since the content is written in a markup language like Markdown, it is easy to edit and maintain, and changes can be made and deployed quickly.\n\nWhy developers like GridsomeSee what developers are saying about how they use Gridsome. Check out popular companies that use Gridsome and some tools that integrate with Gridsome.StackShare\n\nThere are many different static site generators available, each with their own features and capabilities. Some popular static site generators include Jekyll, Gatsby, and Hugo. To choose the right static site generator for your project, it's important to consider factors like the language and framework it is built with, the available plugins and integrations, and the level of customization and control it offers.\n\n\nPopular Static Site Generators\n\n 1. Jekyll: A static site generator written in Ruby that is widely used and well-supported.\n 2. Gatsby: A static site generator built on top of the React JavaScript framework, which allows for building modern and interactive websites.\n 3. Gridsome: Gridsome builds ultra-performance into every page by using the PRPL pattern. You get code splitting, asset optimization, progressive images, and link prefetching out of the box. Gridsome sites get almost perfect page speed scores by default.\n 4. Hugo: A fast and flexible static site generator written in Go.\n 5. Middleman: A static site generator written in Ruby that offers a wide range of features and extensions.\n 6. Eleventy: www.11ty.dev A simple and flexible static site generator written in JavaScript.\n 7. VuePress: A static site generator built on top of the Vue.js JavaScript framework, which is designed for building documentation websites.\n 8. Pelican: A static site generator written in Python that is popular among users of the Python ecosystem.\n 9. Hexo: A fast and flexible static site generator written in JavaScript that is easy to use and customize.\n\nJekyll • Simple, blog-aware, static sitesTransform your plain text into static websites and blogsJekyll • Simple, blog-aware, static sites\n\nThis is just a small selection of the many static site generators available. It's important to choose the one that best fits your needs and the requirements of your project.\n\n\nGraphQL: The Flexible and Efficient Query Language\n\nGraphQL is a query language for your API that was developed and open-sourced by Facebook in 2015. It is designed to provide a more flexible and efficient way for clients to request data from APIs, compared to traditional RESTful APIs.\n\nIn GraphQL, the client specifies exactly the data it needs in a query, and the server returns only that data in the response. This allows the client to request only the data it needs, rather than receiving a fixed set of data from the server as in a REST API. Additionally, GraphQL allows for complex queries that can retrieve data from multiple sources and perform transformations on that data, all in a single request.\n\nGraphQL is often used in the JAMstack architecture as a way to provide backend functionality and data to the frontend of a web application or website. It can be used to fetch data from databases, microservices, and other API sources, and it can be easily integrated into modern web development frameworks like React and Vue.js.\n\nOverall, GraphQL is a powerful and flexible tool for building modern APIs and is widely used by developers around the world.\n\n\nSome JAMSTACK References\n\nNetlify is a platform for building, deploying, and managing modern web applications and websites using the JAMstack architecture. Netlify uses a combination of static site generators, APIs, and a global content delivery network (CDN) to deliver fast and secure websites to users around the world.\n\nDevelop and deploy websites and apps in record time | NetlifyAccelerate the time to deploy your websites and apps.
