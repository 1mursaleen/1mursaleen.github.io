Contributors are untrusted users with the most basic access to your publication.\n\nAuthors\nAuthors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit and publish their own posts.

Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors & Authors to the site.\n\nAdministrators\nThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.\n\nThe Owner\nThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using Ghost(Pro).\n\nAsk all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links.
