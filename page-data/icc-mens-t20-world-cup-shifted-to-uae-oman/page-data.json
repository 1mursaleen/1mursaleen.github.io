Rather than just endlessly posting and hoping someone is listening, you can track real signups against your work and have them subscribe to be notified of future posts. The feature that makes all this possible is called Portal.\n\nPortal is an embedded interface for your audience to sign up to your site. It works on every Ghost site, with every theme, and for any type of publisher.\n\nYou can customize the design, content and settings of Portal to suit your site, whether you just want people to sign up to your newsletter — or you're running a full premium publication with user sign-ins and private content.\n\nOnce people sign up to your site, they'll receive an email confirmation with a link to click. The link acts as an automatic sign-in, so subscribers will be automatically signed-in to your site when they click on it. There are a couple of interesting angles to this:\n\nBecause subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as registered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages depending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some posts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a great draw to encourage people to sign up!\n\nGhost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no passwords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email subscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site. Like magic.\n\nPortal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating button in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out, clicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in, clicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their name, email, and subscription settings.\n\nThe floating Portal button is completely optional. If you prefer, you can add manual links to your content, navigation, or theme to trigger it instead.\n\nLike this! Sign up here\n\nAs you start to grow your registered audience, you'll be able to get a sense of who you're publishing for and where those people are coming from. Best of all: You'll have a straightforward, reliable way to connect with people who enjoy your work.\n\nSocial networks go in and out of fashion all the time. Email addresses are timeless.\n\nGrowing your audience is valuable no matter what type of site you run, but if your content is your business, then you might also be interested in setting up premium subscriptions.","html":"<p>The venue for ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021 has been shifted to the United Arab Emirates and Oman, with the tournament set to run from 17 October to 14 November.</p><p></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-1&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VtYmVkX2NsaWNrYWJpbGl0eV8xMjEwMiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250cm9sIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH19&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1409814436076933126&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.icc-cricket.com%2Fnews%2F2179964&amp;sessionId=57da0f402b8be78553ef2cc9e108bb5b99bbb02b&amp;siteScreenName=icc&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&amp;width=550px\" __idm_frm__=\"613\" data-tweet-id=\"1409814436076933126\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 882px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\"></iframe></figure><p>What sets Ghost apart from other products is that you can publish content and grow your audience using the same platform.
