It is written in the assembly language of the specific CPU architecture and is specific to that architecture. Because native code is specific to a particular architecture, it can be directly executed by the CPU without the need for any additional translation or interpretation.\n\n\nWhat is Bytecode?\n\nBytecode, on the other hand, is a intermediate representation of a program that is not directly executable by the CPU. It is a machine-independent form of code that is generated by a compiler or interpreter from the source code of a program. Bytecode can be executed by a virtual machine, which is a software program that emulates the behavior of a physical CPU.\n\n\nAdvantages of Bytecode\n\nOne of the main advantages of bytecode is that it is portable, meaning that it can be run on any machine with a virtual machine installed, regardless of the underlying hardware architecture.

The process of compilation typically involves analyzing the source code, generating intermediate representations of the code, and then generating the target code based on those intermediate representations. The intermediate representations are often designed to be easier to optimize and transform, which can make the generated code more efficient.\n\nA source-to-source compiler translates between programming languages that operate at approximately the same level of abstraction, while a traditional compiler translates from a higher level programming language to a lower level programming language.\n\nSource-to-source compiler - WikipediaWikimedia Foundation, Inc.Contributors to Wikimedia projects\n\nTypes of Compiler\n\n * Native Code Compiler: The compiler used to compile a source code for same type of platform only. The output generated by this type of compiler can only be run on the same type of computer system and operating system(OS) that the compiler itself runs on.\n * Cross Compiler: The compiler used to compile a source code for different kinds platform.

The process of transpilation is similar to compilation, but the generated code is intended to be readable and maintainable by humans, rather than being optimized for execution by a computer. Transpilers are often used to migrate code from one version of a language to another, or to convert code written in a high-level language into a lower-level language for better performance.\n\nWhereas, Translator converts the source code from one programming language to another programming language of the same or different level of abstraction. Note that result can be a machine code, if source code was also a machine code.\n\nSimply put: \"A transpiler is a source to source program transformation system\".\n\nCompiling vs TranspilingSteve FentonSteve Fenton\n\nTranspiling is a specific term for taking source code written in one language and transforming into another language that has a similar level of abstraction.\n\nFor example: \"Compile\" JSX => JavaScript (and HTML), which matches the definition above, therefore, it can be called 'transpiling'. Though calling it 'compiling' would also be ok.\n\nAnother example: CoffeeScript / TypeScript / whatEverScript => JavaScript and vice versa.\n\n\nDifference between Transpiling and Compiling\n\nOne key difference between transpiling and compiling is that transpiling typically involves a conversion between languages that have a similar level of abstraction, while compiling involves a conversion between languages that may have very different levels of abstraction. For example, a transpiler might convert code written in the latest version of a programming language into an older version of the same language, while a compiler might convert code written in a high-level language like Python into machine code that can be executed directly by a computer's processor.\n\n\nInterpreter\n\nAn interpreter is a program that executes code written in a programming language. It reads the source code one line at a time and executes it immediately, rather than generating a separate executable file. This means that code written in an interpreted language can be run on any machine that has an interpreter for that language, without the need to compile the code first.\n\nThere are several different types of interpreters that are used in computer science and programming:\n\n 1. Command line interpreters: These are programs that interpret and execute commands that are typed into a command line interface. Some examples of command line interpreters include the Bash shell on Unix-like systems and the Command Prompt on Windows systems.\n 2. Scripting language interpreters: These are programs that interpret and execute scripts written in a scripting language. Scripting languages are often used for automating tasks and for writing simple programs that do not require the full power and complexity of a general-purpose programming language. Some examples of scripting languages include Python, Perl, and Ruby.\n 3. Virtual machine interpreters: These are programs that interpret and execute code written for a virtual machine. Virtual machines are abstract computing environments that are implemented in software, and they can be used to execute code written in a variety of different programming languages. Some examples of virtual machines include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR).\n 4. Natural language interpreters: These are programs that interpret and execute commands written in natural language, such as English or Spanish. Natural language interpreters are often used in voice assistants and other applications that allow users to interact with a computer using spoken language.\n\nWhat are compilers, interpreters and transpilers? What is the difference among them, and how do they work?Answer (1 of 4): Compilers convert the source code written in a high level language to machine executable instructions.
