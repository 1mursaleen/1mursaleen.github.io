The cloud-based infrastructure allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and security compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.\n * Automation tools: Automation tools are used to automate various tasks and processes within the software development and deployment lifecycle. Examples of automation tools include continuous integration servers like Jenkins, configuration management tools like Ansible, and build automation tools like Gradle.\n * Containerization technologies: Containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes allow for the creation and management of lightweight, portable containers that can be easily deployed and scaled across multiple environments. These technologies can be used to improve the security and stability of the software and other digital assets and make it easier to deploy and manage applications in the cloud or on-premises.\n * Static testing tools: Static testing tools are used to analyze the source code of a software application without actually executing it. These tools can identify potential security vulnerabilities or other issues in the code that may need to be addressed before the application is deployed.\n * Dynamic testing tools: Dynamic testing tools, also known as runtime testing tools, analyze the behavior of a software application while it is running. These tools can identify issues like memory leaks or performance bottlenecks that may not be detectable through static testing.\n * Monitoring and logging tools: Monitoring and logging tools are used to track the performance and availability of software and other digital assets. These tools can generate alerts when issues arise, and provide detailed logs and metrics for troubleshooting and analysis.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of tools and technologies that may be used as part of the Platform One program.
