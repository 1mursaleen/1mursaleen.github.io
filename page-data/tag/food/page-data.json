Many themes will use your accent color as the background for buttons, headers and navigational elements.

Each theme is suited to slightly different use-cases.\n\n * Casper (default) — Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters\n * Edition — A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors\n * Alto — A slick news/magazine style design for creators\n * London — A light photography theme with a bold grid\n * Ease — A library theme for organizing large content archives\n\nAnd if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the Ghost Marketplace, where you'll find a huge variety of both free and premium themes.\n\n\nBuilding something custom\n\nFinally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always build a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.\n\nGhost's theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up in the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with relatively little effort.\n\nIf you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it's like, you can browse through the files of the default Casper theme. We've added tons of inline code comments to make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.\n\nSee? Not that scary!
