This includes implementing agile development methodologies, which emphasize rapid iteration and delivery, as well as continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices, which allow for the rapid and reliable deployment of code changes.\n * In addition to supporting the development process, the Platform One program also focuses on ensuring the security and stability of the DoD's digital assets. This includes implementing secure code development practices, such as static and dynamic testing, and using tools and technologies like containerization and cloud-based infrastructure to improve security and scalability.\n * The Platform One program also provides a range of tools and technologies to support its services, including cloud-based infrastructure, automation tools, and containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

The cloud-based infrastructure allows for greater scalability, flexibility, and security compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.\n * Automation tools: Automation tools are used to automate various tasks and processes within the software development and deployment lifecycle. Examples of automation tools include continuous integration servers like Jenkins, configuration management tools like Ansible, and build automation tools like Gradle.\n * Containerization technologies: Containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes allow for the creation and management of lightweight, portable containers that can be easily deployed and scaled across multiple environments. These technologies can be used to improve the security and stability of the software and other digital assets and make it easier to deploy and manage applications in the cloud or on-premises.\n * Static testing tools: Static testing tools are used to analyze the source code of a software application without actually executing it. These tools can identify potential security vulnerabilities or other issues in the code that may need to be addressed before the application is deployed.\n * Dynamic testing tools: Dynamic testing tools, also known as runtime testing tools, analyze the behavior of a software application while it is running. These tools can identify issues like memory leaks or performance bottlenecks that may not be detectable through static testing.\n * Monitoring and logging tools: Monitoring and logging tools are used to track the performance and availability of software and other digital assets. These tools can generate alerts when issues arise, and provide detailed logs and metrics for troubleshooting and analysis.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the types of tools and technologies that may be used as part of the Platform One program.

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD): CI/CD is a set of practices that involves integrating code changes frequently and delivering software updates continuously. This allows organizations to release software updates more frequently, while also ensuring that new code is thoroughly tested before it is released.\n 2. Automated testing: Automated testing is a key part of DevSecOps, as it allows organizations to test their software automatically, rather than relying on manual testing. This helps to ensure that software is thoroughly tested and that any vulnerabilities are identified and fixed early in the development process.\n 3. Collaboration: DevSecOps is a collaborative approach that involves bringing together developers, security professionals, and operations teams to work together to deliver software. By working together, these teams can ensure that security is integrated into the development process and that any vulnerabilities are identified and fixed early.\n 4. Use of open source tools: Many organizations use open source tools to automate security testing and other DevSecOps practices. These tools allow organizations to test their software automatically and identify any vulnerabilities, without having to invest in expensive proprietary solutions.\n\nWhat is DevSecOps?If you want to take full advantage of the agility and responsiveness of DevOps, IT security must play a role in the full life cycle of your apps.\n\n\nThe benefits of DevSecOps\n\nThere are several benefits to adopting a DevSecOps approach to software development and delivery:\n\n 1. Faster delivery of software updates: By automating security testing and integrating it into the development process, organizations can release software updates more quickly, as they can identify and fix vulnerabilities early in the development process. This allows organizations to deliver value to their customers more quickly and stay ahead of the competition.\n 2. Improved security: By integrating security into the development process, organizations can create more secure software. Automated security testing allows organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities early in the development process before they become a problem. This helps to prevent security breaches and protect the organization and its customers.\n 3. Increased efficiency: DevSecOps helps to streamline the development process by automating many of the tasks that would normally be done manually. This increases the efficiency of the development process and allows organizations to deliver software faster.\n 4. Enhanced collaboration: DevSecOps is a collaborative approach that involves bringing together developers, security professionals, and operations teams to work together to deliver software. This enhances collaboration across teams and helps to ensure that security is integrated into the development process.\n 5. Cost savings: By automating security testing and other tasks, organizations can save time and reduce the need for manual testing. This can help to reduce costs and improve the bottom line.\n\nThe benefits of DevSecOps include faster delivery of software updates, improved security, increased efficiency, enhanced collaboration, and cost savings. By integrating security into the development process, organizations can create more secure software faster and more efficiently.\n\nWhat is DevSecOps?Learn how the DevSecOps model integrates security throughout the development lifecycle and explore essential skills and tools for DevSecOps engineers.TechTargetLinda Rosencrance\n\n\nOrganizations that have adopted DevSecOps approach\n\nMany organizations have adopted a DevSecOps approach to software development and delivery in order to improve the security of their software and deliver updates faster. By integrating security into the development process and automating testing, these organizations are able to deliver more secure software more efficiently.\n\nSome examples of organizations that have implemented DevSecOps include:\n\n 1. Amazon: Amazon is a leader in the use of DevSecOps and has implemented many of the key practices, including continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), automated testing, and collaboration across teams.\n 2. Google: Google has also embraced DevSecOps and has implemented a number of automated testing tools to ensure that their software is secure.\n 3. Netflix: Netflix has been a pioneer in the use of DevSecOps and has implemented a number of automated testing tools to ensure that their software is secure.\n 4. Microsoft: Microsoft has adopted a DevSecOps approach and has implemented a number of automated testing tools to ensure that their software is secure.\n 5. Salesforce.\n\n\nDevSecOps Tools\n\nThere are many different tools available to support the implementation of a DevSecOps approach, including tools for continuous integration and delivery, automated testing, security testing, and collaboration. These tools allow organizations to automate many of the tasks involved in the software development process and ensure that their software is secure. Some examples of DevSecOps tools include:\n\n 1. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tools: These tools automate the process of integrating code changes and delivering software updates. Examples include Jenkins, GitLab, and Azure DevOps.\n 2. Automated testing tools: These tools allow organizations to test their software automatically, rather than relying on manual testing. Examples include Selenium, Appium, and TestComplete.\n 3. Security testing tools: These tools help organizations to identify and fix vulnerabilities in their software. Examples include Nessus, Burp Suite, and Veracode.\n 4. Collaboration tools: These tools enable developers, security professionals, and operations teams to work together and collaborate on software development and delivery. Examples include Slack, Trello, and Asana.\n\nKubernetes, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Aqua & many more...\n\nDownload Nessus Vulnerability Assessment | Nessus®Nessus - The global gold standard in vulnerability assessment and built for the modern attack surface.
